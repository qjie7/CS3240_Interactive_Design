## CS3240 Interactive Design AY2020/2021

In Year 4 Semester 1 in  AY2020/2021, I picked CS3240 as one of my technical elective module. 

After going through the module, I fall in love with UI/UX design and frontend technology such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This repo consist of various assignment and projects that I have done throughout the course.

Last but not least, below is a design portfolio link for the final group project assignment (A design project that aim to help NUS student who stay in hostel to manage their shared fridge in a more efficient and well organised manner).
